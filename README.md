# Wk3-code-challenge
In this project I have 3 files:
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the shopping list.
script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the interactive shopping list.


- Users can add new items to the shopping list.
- Users can mark items as purchased, which will visually update the item
- Users can edit existing items by clicking on them.
- Users can clear the entire list with a single button click.
